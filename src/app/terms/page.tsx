            Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before commissioning print production

              1. Digital Proof Approval & Production Authorization
            </h2>
            <p>
              For any order containing customer-provided artwork, Star Press generates a digital
              pre-press proof (soft proof) for customer review. Production commences solely upon your
              affirmative written approval (via Email, Website confirmation, or WhatsApp).
            </p>
            <p className="text-white font-medium">
              Your approval constitutes final verification of spelling, grammar, phone numbers,
              QR codes, visual layouts, and fold orientations. Star Press is not liable for errors
              present in the approved proof file.

              2. Color Calibration & Screen RGB vs Print CMYK
            </h2>
            <p>
              Due to physical variations between back-lit computer/mobile screens (which display RGB
              light) and physical printing inks (which reflect CMYK pigments onto paper substrates),
              printed colors may exhibit subtle chromatic differences compared to on-screen previews.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xs text-text-muted">
              Star Press calibrates all commercial presses to ISO 12647-2 / FogRA 39 standards. A
              color difference delta (ΔE) within industry-standard tolerance margins (3ΔE) is normal
              and does not constitute a printing defect. For exact brand matching, customers are
              encouraged to specify Pantone Matching System (PMS) spot codes.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Industrial paper guillotines and die-cutting machines operate with mechanical tolerances.
              A shifting margin of up to <strong>±1.5mm</strong> may occur during high-volume trimming
              and folding. All critical design elements (text, borders, logos) must be placed within
              our designated Safe Zone (at least 3.5mm from the trim line) with a 3mm external bleed.

              4. Turnaround Times & Courier Transit
            </h2>
            <p>
              Production turnaround times represent the duration required to manufacture, inspect,
              and pack your order. Production begins on the business day following receipt of proof
              approval (orders approved after 2:00 PM IST commence the next business day).
            </p>
            <p>
              While Star Press partners exclusively with premier logistics services (Blue Dart,
              Delhivery, DTDC), courier transit times are external to manufacturing and may be
              impacted by regional weather conditions, regional holidays, or force majeure events.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-text-secondary">
              Because custom-printed goods cannot be restocked or resold, orders cannot be cancelled

              However, if your delivered order has a genuine manufacturing defect attributable to
              Star Press (such as streaking ink, incorrect paper stock, cutting misregistration
              exceeding tolerance, or transit packaging damage), notify our team within{" "}
              <strong>48 hours of delivery</strong> with photographic evidence. We will rush-reprint

              and permissions for all text, photographs, graphics, and brand assets submitted for
              printing. The customer agrees to defend and indemnify Star Press from any claims,
