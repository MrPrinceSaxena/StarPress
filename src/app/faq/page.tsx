  // Category 1: Artwork & Pre-Press Guidelines
  {
    id: "art-1",
    category: "Artwork & Design Files",
    question: "What file formats do you accept for custom printing?",
    answer:
      "We accept vector PDF (.pdf), Adobe Illustrator (.ai), Photoshop (.psd), CorelDraw (.cdr), SVG, and high-resolution uncompressed TIFF or PNG. For maximum sharpness and crisp typography, vector PDF with all fonts converted to curves/outlines is our top recommendation.",
  },
  {
    id: "art-2",
    category: "Artwork & Design Files",
    question: "Why should my files be in CMYK instead of RGB?",
    answer:
      "Computer monitors emit light in RGB (Red, Green, Blue), whereas physical printing presses lay physical pigments in CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key Black). Colors designed in RGB may appear up to 15% darker or shift in saturation when printed. We recommend designing directly in CMYK (FOGRA39 or Coated GRACoL profile) to guarantee color accuracy.",
  },
  {
    id: "art-3",
    category: "Artwork & Design Files",
    question: "What are bleed and safety margin lines?",
    answer:
      "Bleed is the extra 3mm (0.125 inches) of artwork that extends beyond the actual cut line of your document. Because industrial guillotines cut stacks of hundreds of sheets at once with slight mechanical movement, bleed prevents unsightly white hairline borders. Keep all critical logos, text, and graphics at least 4mm inside the trim line (safe zone).",
  },
  {
    id: "art-4",
    category: "Artwork & Design Files",
    question: "What resolution must my images have?",
    answer:
      "All raster images and photos must be at least 300 DPI (dots per inch) at 100% final physical print size. Images downloaded from WhatsApp or web pages are typically 72 DPI and will look pixelated or blurry when printed on commercial presses.",
  },

  // Category 2: Turnaround & Production Times
  {
    id: "prod-1",
    category: "Production & Turnaround",
    question: "How long does standard printing take?",
    answer:
      "Standard commercial production takes 2 to 4 business days depending on finishing options (e.g. Spot UV, thermal matte lamination, and foiling require 24 hours of curing). Once dispatched, courier transit takes 1 to 4 business days depending on your delivery PIN code.",
  },
  {
    id: "prod-2",
    category: "Production & Turnaround",
    question: "Do you offer 24-hour rush dispatch?",
    answer:
      "Yes! You can select 'Priority 24h Rush' at checkout. For orders approved before our daily 2:00 PM IST cutoff, your job skips to the front of our digital HP Indigo press queue and dispatches within 24 to 48 hours via express air courier.",
  },
  {
    id: "prod-3",
    category: "Production & Turnaround",
    question: "Will I get to see a proof before mass printing starts?",
    answer:
      "Always. For every order with uploaded custom artwork, our human prepress department generates a digital soft proof and sends it via WhatsApp and Email. We only start production after receiving your explicit approval.",
  },

  // Category 3: Pan-India Shipping & Packaging
  {
    id: "ship-1",
    category: "Shipping & Delivery",
    question: "Where do you ship across India?",
    answer:
      "We ship to 26,000+ PIN codes across all Indian states and Union Territories via premier express logistics partners including Blue Dart, Delhivery, and DTDC. Orders above ₹999 qualify for Free Pan-India Standard Shipping.",
  },
  {
    id: "ship-2",
    category: "Shipping & Delivery",
    question: "How do you package sensitive paper goods?",
    answer:
      "We take packaging seriously. All business cards, brochures, and flyers are shrink-wrapped in moisture-proof polypropylene plastic, surrounded with bubble wrap, and packed into heavy 5-ply corrugated shipper boxes with edge corner guards to prevent transit dents.",
  },
  {
    id: "ship-3",
    category: "Shipping & Delivery",
    question: "How do I track my dispatched parcel?",
    answer:
      "The instant your order leaves our Okhla printing hub, you receive an automated SMS and WhatsApp message with your direct courier tracking link and AWB number for live milestone tracking.",
  },

  // Category 4: Payments, GST & Invoicing
  {
    id: "pay-1",
    category: "Payments & GST Invoicing",
    question: "What payment methods are supported?",
    answer:
      "We accept all major UPI applications (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm), Credit and Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, RuPay), NetBanking from 50+ Indian banks, and Pay-After-Proof Approval for verified business accounts.",
  },
  {
    id: "pay-2",
    category: "Payments & GST Invoicing",
    question: "Can I get a GST tax invoice to claim 18% Input Tax Credit?",
    answer:
      "Yes. During checkout, check the 'I need a GST Invoice for my Business' box and enter your 15-character GSTIN and Registered Company Name. Your official tax invoice containing full HSN codes will be emailed automatically upon dispatch.",
  },

  // Category 5: Quality Guarantee & Reprints
  {
    id: "qual-1",
    category: "Quality & Reprint Guarantee",
    question: "What if there is a printing flaw or cutting defect?",
    answer:
      "We back our print quality with a 100% Free Reprint Guarantee. If your order exhibits printing defects, color banding, cut misalignments, or transit damage, photograph the issue and notify us within 48 hours of delivery. We will rush-reprint and reship your entire order at zero cost.",
  },
  {
    id: "qual-2",
    category: "Quality & Reprint Guarantee",
    question: "Can I request physical paper swatches before placing a large order?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Visit our Bulk Orders page or contact our team to request a Free Hardcopy Sample Swatch Kit containing textured paper grades, 300/350/400 GSM boards, velvet soft-touch laminates, and foil swatches.",
